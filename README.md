# word-dash

python program that tests users typing speed (accuracy too soon enough)

- The users speed is measured in Characters Per Second/Minute (CPS/CPM) 
- Phrases to be typed are of less than 50 characers said phrases are acquired from the [quotable api](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable#get-random-quote)  
- The typing done by the user is character sensetive meaning words, letters and punctuation marks must be input correctly
- The sentence typed by the user will be display as red and the timer will still count until the user finishes typing the sentence correctly at which point it will be green (make a How To Play tab in the program for this)

To run the program you download the [zip file](https://github.com/snglenote/word-dash/releases/tag/v0.1.0) and extract it and run the executable inside the dist folder (wdash.exe)
